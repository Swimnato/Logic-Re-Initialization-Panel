# Logic Initialization Panel

Created by the BYU IEEE Branch for the CMSC

## Overview
The idea is that you take an isolinear chip that is "broken" and you place it in to have a certain logic circuit "fixed/repaired" the screen gives you a guide to be able to solve the puzzle/prompt. you then "write" it to the card

### Puzzle setup
The puzzle would consist of a series of (up to) 4 inputs and (up to) 4 outputs. These inputs could be things such as "Engine overheating" or "Autorization level 4 is given" or "Fire detected". The outputs could be "Turn on cooling fans" or "Override safety protocols" or "open airlock" etc. The user would be responsible for implemmenting the logic necessary to solve the puzzle at hand. 

### Interactivity
The user can test inputs manually by pressing the 4 buttons off to the input side of the logic panel, turning them on or off (true or false). They can then visually see how the logic would travel step by step in their current circuit.

### Completion
When they are ready to submit they hit the write button and it tests their circuit to verify correctness. If it is incorrect it throws an error and lets them try again. If it is correct it "writes" it to the card and they can move the card back to its original position to "fix" or "optimize" a system

## Learning outcomes
This panel teaches basic boolean logic (not, and, or) to children, or can be configured to challenge adults with more gates/configurations.

### Initial Concept
Will be cut down, since this was originally started as a whole panel idea and was cut down to be a sub-panel.
